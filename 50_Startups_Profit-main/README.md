# 50_Startups_Profit
This dataset contains four independent variables: R&amp;D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State. Our task is to use this data to train a Machine Learning model that can understand how these variables relate to the Profit. With this knowledge, we can predict the profit for a new company based on its data.
1. R&D spending: The amount which startups are spending on Research and development.
2. Administration spending: The amount which startups are spending on the Admin panel.
3. Marketing spending: The amount which startups are spending on marketing strategies.
4. State: To which state that particular startup belongs.
